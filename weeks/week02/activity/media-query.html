            <h2>1 Nephi 8:12</h2>
            <p>
                And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly
                great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should
                partake of it also; for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit.

            <h2>Mosiah 3:19</h2>
            <p>
                19 For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam,
                and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit,
                and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ
                the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love,
                willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even
                as a child doth submit to his father.
